1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,300
Up in the sky look!

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,000
 It's a bird. It's a plane.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's Superman!

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In the endless reaches of the universe there once existed a planet known as Krypton.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A planet that burned like a green star in the distant heavens.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,500
There, civilization was far advanced, and had brought forth a race of supermen.

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But, there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
One of the planet's leading scientists, sensing the approach of doom,

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
placed his infant son in a small rocket ship and sent it hurtling in the direction of the Earth.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just as Krypton exploded!

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,500
The rocket ship sped through star-studded space,

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Landing safely on Earth with its precious burden, Krypton's sole survivor.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A passing motorist found the uninjured child, and took it to an orphanage.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
As the years went by and the child grew to maturity, he found himself possessed with amazing physical powers.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Faster than a speeding bullet.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
More powerful than a locomotive.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The infant of Krypton is now the Man of Steel!

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Superman!

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
To best be in a position to use his amazing powers in a never ending battle for truth and justice,

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Superman has assumed the disguise of Clark Kent,

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mild mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper.

23
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
Kent, I want to see you.

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Just received another threatening note.

25
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay Mr White.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,500
Lois, another note from the mad scientist.

27
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Coming in chief.

28
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Now listen to this warning. He plans to strike tonight.

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Beware you fools. My Electrothanasia-ray strikes tonight at 12.

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,000
Total destruction will come to those who laughed at me and failed to heed my warnings.

31
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Beware, I strike at midnight.

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
This nut may prove dangerous!

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Kent, you help Lois follow up her lead. She may have an angle on this thing.

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Yes sir.

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
But chief, I'd like the chance to crack the story on my own.

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Well, I'll...

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,000
Thanks chief.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But, Lois?

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Chief don't you think that's a dangerous mission?

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The hour has come.
